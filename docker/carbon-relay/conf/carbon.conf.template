# that map to a given aggregation rule are sent to the same carbon-aggregator
# instance.
# Enable this for carbon-relays that send to a group of carbon-aggregators
#RELAY_METHOD = aggregated-consistent-hashing

# and will always redirect the metrics to the same destination but do not try

# DESTINATIONS = 127.0.0.1:2004:a, 127.0.0.1:2104:b
#
# The general form is IP:PORT:INSTANCE where the :INSTANCE part is
# optional and refers to the "None" instance if omitted.

# exactly match the webapp's CARBONLINK_HOSTS setting in terms of
# instances listed (order matters!).

# must be defined in this list
